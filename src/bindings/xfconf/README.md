## Introduction

These bindings provide an implementation of the xfconf header files such that libelektra can be used as a drop-in replacement for xfconf.
In other words, it makes applications which rely on xfconf for their configuration use libelektra without the necessity for modifying their source code or even recompiling them.

For further understanding how xfconf is structured, please refer to the [xfconf plugin](../../../src/plugins/xfconf/README.md#xfconf-terminology).

## Files

- The header files of this implementation are provided by xfconf and are not included here.
- The resulting library is called `libxfconfbinding.so`

## Classes

## Dependencies

### Compile-Time

The xfconf library from the XFCE project is the main dependency of this plugin.
Usually, this library is called something such as `xfconf` (Arch, Fedora, `xfconf-devel` for compiling), `libxfconf-0` (Debian/Ubuntu, `libxfconf-0-dev` for compmiling) or `xfce4-conf` (FreeBSD) in the package manager.
As xfconf itself depends on dbus and glib, these are dependencies too but should be installed with the package manager automatically.
This binding requires the Xfce, xfconf versions `4.16` and above.

### Runtime

Beside libelektra and glib, nothing else is required at runtime.
However, as these bindings act as a drop-in replacement, the `xfconf` library might be a conflicting library if you want to install it as such.

## Installation

In order that these bindings can be used as a drop-in replacement for xfconf, the original library must be replaced.
Assuming that the library directory is `/usr/local/lib`, this can be achieved as follows:

1. copy the `libxfconfbinding.so` to `/usr/local/lib/libxfconfbinding.so.0.0.1`
2. symlink `/usr/local/lib/libxfconfbinding.so.0` to `/usr/local/lib/libxfconfbinding.so.0.0.1`
3. symlink `/usr/local/lib/libxfconfbinding.so` to `/usr/local/lib/libxfconfbinding.so.0.0.1`
4. symlink `/usr/local/lib/libxfconf-0.so.3.0.0` to `/usr/local/lib/libxfconfbinding.so.0.0.1`
5. take the symlinks `/usr/local/lib/libxfconf-0.so.3` and `/usr/local/lib/libxfconf-.so` which point to `/usr/local/lib/libxfconf-0.so` from the upstream xfconf library and place them into you system

This can be also achieved using the [system replace script](scripts/replace-system-xfconf.sh).
These changes can be reverted with the [system restore script](scripts/restore-system-xfconf.sh).
Note, that both scripts must be run directly within the build root.
However, there are more convenient ways to achieve that as described [below](#using-the-binding-as-a-replacement-in-xfce).

## Using the binding as a replacement in Xfce

It is currently possible to use this binding instead of Xfconf in order to start and use Xfce.

**Caution:** Although it is in general possible to use this binding as a replacement it is not recommended at all.
Currently, it shows an unpredictable behavior for an unknown reason.
A few of the undesired effects are:

- Inconsistent layout of the taskbar every session restart
- Missing symbols in menus despite being configured to appear
- Weird animations during the session startup
  One guess is, this is the result of race-conditions since Xfce consists of multiple components which concurrently read and write configuration.

Use with caution and on non-production systems such as virtual machines only.

The following instructions only have an effect on the current user which allows a quick revert through a different user.

Build elektra as instructed in the [COMPILE](../../../doc/COMPILE.md#developer-options) and do not forget to include the `xfconfbinding`.

After building, the library has to be overridden with the [user replace script](scripts/replace-user-xfconf.sh).
Again, the working directory must be the build root.
Then the Xfce configuration must be initialized using:

1. `source $HOME/.xprofile`
2. running the [population script](scripts/populate-xfconf.sh)

When done, the graphical session can be started and will now use elektra for the Xfce configuration.

To restore the usage of the systems Xfconf, it is enough to remove the `LD_*` exports from `$HOME/.xprofile`

## Debugging

For debugging purposes, it might be useful to output and log all debug messages from glib.
This can be done by appending the `G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all` environment variable to all the above-mentioned places.
However, this is already done by the [user replace script](scripts/replace-user-xfconf.sh).
All components responsible for starting the Xfce session will log their output wherever the display-manager stores the log files.
All applications started from the command line will put their debug log to the stderr.

## Quality

Note that this binding only handles configuration directly handles within Xfconf.
It is not able to configure settings which live outside Xfconf such as Gtk themes.
However, since settings such as the Gtk theme part of the Xfce desktop itself, this binding is not able to configure Xfce fully.
