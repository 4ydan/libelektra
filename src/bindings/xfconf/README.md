## Introduction

These bindings provide an implementation of the xfconf header files such that libelektra can be used as a drop-in replacement for xfconf.
In other words, it makes applications which rely on xfconf for their configuration use libelektra without the necessity for modifying their source code or even recompiling them.

For further understanding how xfconf is structured, please refer to the [xfconf plugin](../../../src/plugins/xfconf/README.md#xfconf-terminology).

## Files

- The header files of this implementation are provided by xfconf and are not included here.
- The resulting library is called `libxfconfbinding.so`

## Classes

## Dependencies

### Compile-Time

The xfconf library from the XFCE project is the main dependency of this plugin.
Usually, this library is called something such as `xfconf` (Arch, Fedora, `xfconf-devel` for compiling), `libxfconf-0` (Debian, `libxfconf-0-dev` for compmiling) or `xfce4-conf` (FreeBSD) in the package manager.
As xfconf itself depends on dbus and glib, these are dependencies too but should be installed with the package manager automatically.
This plugin is tested with the xfconf versions `4.16` and above.

### Runtime

Beside libelektra and glib, nothing else is required at runtime.
However, as these bindings act as a drop-in replacement, the `xfconf` library might be a conflicting library if you want to install it as such.

## Installation

In order that these bindings can be used as a drop-in replacement for xfconf, the original library must be replaced.
Assuming that the library directory is `/usr/local/lib`, this can be achieved as follows:

1. copy the `libxfconfbinding.so` to `/usr/local/lib/libxfconfbinding.so.0.0.1`
2. symlink `/usr/local/lib/libxfconfbinding.so.0` to `/usr/local/lib/libxfconfbinding.so.0.0.1`
3. symlink `/usr/local/lib/libxfconfbinding.so` to `/usr/local/lib/libxfconfbinding.so.0.0.1`
4. symlink `/usr/local/lib/libxfconf-0.so.3.0.0` to `/usr/local/lib/libxfconfbinding.so.0.0.1`
5. take the symlinks `/usr/local/lib/libxfconf-0.so.3` and `/usr/local/lib/libxfconf-.so` which point to `/usr/local/lib/libxfconf-0.so` from the upstream xfconf library and place them into you system
